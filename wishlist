Wishlist:

First priority: add backstitch lines to an already otherwise finished design.

Not in any particular order:
generate pattern from design (with symbols, legend, etc)
take in small image, convert to dmc colors (approximated to rgb values)
create "squares" design with dmc colors
categorize colors
maintain listing of the floss colors I have and how much of each
"type" with basic alphabet design
select color (eye dropper)
